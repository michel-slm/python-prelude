Prelude library for Python
==========================
This library provides functional programming constructs from languages
such as Haskell and Scala, implemented using existing Python libraries
such as ``abc`` (*abstract base class*) as appropriate.

The intention is for this to complement the existing ``functools`` library,
not to replace it.


Installation
